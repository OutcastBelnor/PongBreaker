# PongBreaker
A mix of Arkanoid/Block Breaker and Pong classic arcade games made using Unity game engine.

This project is still under development. There are only two people working on it:
  - Jakub Janas (OutcastBelnor) - Unity scripting and Scene editing
  - Jakub Jo≈Ñski (UherDoru) - graphics and textures
  
The main game mode is simple: there are two players (one can be AI(not implemented yet)) who compete against themselves in Pong-like style game. The difference is that between the players there are block obstacles.

So far only the core game functions are implemented: the playspace (a box-like environment in which the ball cannot escape), player board, the ball.
